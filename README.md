Boxer

OpenGL widget library for games based on the CSS box model.

Many subtle but powerful differences between this library 
and the CSS box model are due to the fact that HTML is
designed around the layout of text, while this library
is designed for positioning relative to images.

The biggest implication of this difference is that Boxer
does not have a natural flow.
